Revision history for Perl module SourceForge::API

0.01 Thu Jul  5 15:58:15 2012
    - original version; created by ExtUtils::ModuleMaker 0.51

0.02
    - Added SourceForge::API, SourceForge::User, and
      SourceForge::Project modules to model the base data objects. Will
      no doubt need more as we progress, but this is a good start. Goal
      of first release is to be able to fetch a User object from the
      API, and a Project object from the API, which have basic details.
      Possibly a command-line script or two that demonstrate the
      functionality.

0.10
    - Big step towards milestone 1. Project returns basic project info.
      Could probably use this for actual useful things now.
