=head1 WWW::SourceForge

The WWW::SourceForge family of modules are intended to implement the API
documented at https://sourceforge.net/p/forge/documentation/API/

While this isn't an "official" SourceForge project, I am a SourceForge
employee, and maintain these as part of my job. I also use these modules as part
of my daily tasks, and so I have an interest in making them work well.

These are part of a larger package of tools
(https://sourceforge.net/projects/sfprojecttools/) including
greasemonkey scripts, and hopefully some day other implementations of
the API (PHP and Python would be a winner).
