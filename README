NAME
    WWW::SourceForge - Interfaces to the SourceForge data API

SYNOPSIS
    The WWW::SourceForge family of modules are intended to implement the API
    documented at https://sourceforge.net/p/forge/documentation/API/

    While this isn't an "official" SourceForge project, I am a SourceForge
    employee, and maintain these as part of my job. I also use these modules
    as part of my daily tasks, and so I have an interest in making them work
    well.

    These are part of a larger package of tools
    (https:/sourceforge.net/projects/sfprojecttools/) including
    greasemonkey scripts, and hopefully some day other implementations of
    the API (PHP and Python would be a winner).

USAGE
  WWW::SourceForge::User
     Usage: 
 
        my $user = new WWW::SourceForge::User( id => 1234 );
        my $user2 = new WWW::SourceForge::User( username => 'rbowen' );
        my @projects = $user->projects(); # WWW::SourceForge::Project objects

  WWW::SourceForge::Project
     Usage: 
 
        my $proj = new WWW::SourceForge::Project( id => 1234 );
        my $proj2 = new WWW::SourceForge::Project( name => 'flightics' );

        my @admins = $proj->admins(); # WWW::SourceForge::User objects
        my @developers = $proj->developers(); # Ditto

        # WARNING: This method is probably going to change in the future to
        # return more detailed download data. Check docs frequently.
        my $download_count = $proj->downloads(
            start_date => '2012-07-01',
            end_date   => '2012-07-25'
        );

HISTORY
    A WWW::SourceForge module was originally developed by Kang-min Liu
    (gugod@gugod.org), which utilized WWW::Mechanize to retrieve project
    information from SourceForge project pages. With the many changes to the
    SourceForge website, that module gradually fell out of usefulness. With
    the new(ish) SourceForge data API, we have a means of accessing this
    data without having to parse HTML. But many thanks to Kang-min Liu for
    his early effort, and for his cooperation with me.
